# [99 Cats](http://secure-meadow-9105.herokuapp.com/)

Rails inventory app (tracking cats!). Has basic user authentication, each user can own many cats and rent them out to other users. Users can request other users' cats and the owner will either approve or deny their request (including smart logic for auto-denying other overlapping calendar requests if necessary).

Live on heroku @ live above (pardon the load time).
